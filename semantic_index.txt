Why do you say that?

I have accepted Provolone into my life!

What makes you believe you have accepted provolone into your life?

It's 74 degrees, 12 minutes NORTH, and 41 degrees, 3 minutes EAST!!
 Soon, it will be TUESDAY!!

Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

GOOD-NIGHT, everybody..  Now I have to go administer FIRST-AID
 to my pet LEISURE SUIT!!

I don't understand.

I'm QUIETLY reading the latest issue of ``BOWLING WORLD''
 while my wife and two children stand QUIETLY BY..

Tell me something about your family.

How do I get HOME?

Is it because do you get home that you came to me?

Kids, the seven basic food groups are GUM, PUFF PASTRY, PIZZA,
 PESTICIDES, ANTIBIOTICS, NUTRA-SWEET and MILK DUDS!!

  /home/david/Dokumente/Code/gramps/web-api/tests/test_endpoints/__init__.py:30: DeprecationWarning: jsonschema.RefResolver is deprecated as of v4.18.0, in favor of the https://github.com/python-jsonschema/referencing library, which provides more compliant referencing behavior as well as more flexible APIs for customization. A future release will remove RefResolver. Please file a feature request (on referencing) if you are missing an API for the kind of customization you need.
